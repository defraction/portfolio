                                <p>Hello, my name is Hwapyeong Yoo, and 
                                I am a freshman at Dublin High currently in 2018. 
                                I think that we, as human beings, just want two things 
                                in life: Satisfaction and Happiness. We do everything in 
                                order to achieve those two things, whether it be 
                                being academically successful for a good job that 
                                pays well, or finding hobbies and interests that we 
                                can work on to improve at. Because of this, I 
                                strive to be a person who is satisfied with himself 
                                and is able to help others obtain happiness and 
                                satisfation for themselves. Whether it be from 
                                becoming a programmer to design games that bring 
                                enjoyment to people's life, or becoming a humanitarian 
                                who can help people in extreme need. <br><br>Some 
                                traits that I have that will allow me to help people 
                                are that I am patient and a team player. From about 
                                9 years ago, my brother was born with a chromosome 
                                deletion which put him on the autism spectrum. 
                                Living with him for that long of a time led me to 
                                develop a extremely long patience which can be 
                                utilized to hear people out and give support to them. 
                                Also, I always try to work for the good of all instead 
                                of one even if it includes self-sacrifice. That will 
                                let me work for others and still find my own joy while 
                                helpings others find theirs. <br><br>In terms of 
                                achievements in school, I do not really have any 
                                currently, but will continue striving for them. 
                                Also, as of now I do not have any work experience 
                                built up, but I am planning to possibly start volunteering 
                                in a variety of different places to make myself an all-around 
                                better and knowledgable person. Overall, I would 
                                like to develop my overall general knowledge so 
                                I can help people achieve the two fundementals that 
                                everyone strives for: Happiness and Satisfaction.</p>
